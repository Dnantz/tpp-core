This directory contains POCOs for generic pokemon related data that adhere to the
 [pokecat specification](https://github.com/TwitchPlaysPokemon/pokecat/blob/master/unified_objects.md)
and are therefore also suitable for exchange between systems.
This includes proper serialization, if the serializer used recognizes data contract annotations
(e.g. JSON.net does by default).
