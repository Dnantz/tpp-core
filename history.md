# History of TPP source code

The TPP source code dating back to 2014 is not public. The private repository contains an extensive collection of source code, components, files, and data. This repository contains a rewrite of a portion of the source code known as the *core*.

The core is responsible for much of the functionality behind the scenes. The core handles reading chat inputs, chat moderation, command processing, account balances, etc. What viewers on the TwitchPlaysPokemon Twitch channel see is the *overlay*.

The overlay displays all the meta information about the game such as commands, party information, and the current time. The overlay composited, using OBS, with emulator screen capture or video capture devices hence the name "overlay".
