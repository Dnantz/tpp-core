This repository contains the open-source rewrite of the TwitchPlaysPokemon core codebase.
Its main goals are the following:

  - Switch to a statically typed language for more guarantees about code structure and correctness.
  - Use our experiences with the current tpp core to get things _right_, or at least implement them nicer.
  - Be open source to allow contributions from anyone.
  - Drop the frustration dealing with old code, and instead siphon the motivation of doing something fresh

The whole repository, including this document, is still very much under heavy development.
Once we've reached a certain level of development, we will provide more detailed information on how the new codebase is structured, what technologies are used, and what components it consists of.
