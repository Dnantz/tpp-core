![travis-ci build](https://api.travis-ci.org/TwitchPlaysPokemon/tpp-core.svg?branch=master)

This repository contains the open-source rewrite of the TwitchPlaysPokemon core codebase.
Its main goals are the following:

  - Switch to a statically typed language (C#) for more guarantees about code structure and correctness.
  - Use our experiences with the current tpp core to get things _right_, or at least implement them nicer.
  - Be open source to allow contributions from anyone.
  - Drop the frustration dealing with old code, and instead siphon the motivation of doing something fresh

The whole repository, including this document, is still very much under heavy development.
Once we've reached a certain level of development, we will provide more detailed information on how the new codebase is structured, what technologies are used, and what components it consists of.

### I want to contribute

Yes, please! Any help is appreciated.
Because this project is still very fresh and barebones, it might be hard for you to find a good place to start though.
Depending on your workflow, you can do one of the following:
- Contact one of the core contributors to get invited into the TPP Discord, where you can get directly involved into relevant discussions.
  We are willing to help you get started, just hit someone up. If you don't know where, a Twitch whisper works. Preferable whisper FelkCraft.
- If you already know what you want to add/change, feel free to just tinker around and submit a pull request.
- We'll try to organize things that need to be done as Github issues. You can browse through them and see if something fits for you.
  Don't be shy to ask for help if necessary. You don't need to do something all by yourself to get started.
